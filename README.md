SURV 400 Final


Green spaces, defined as areas of natural vegetation accessible for recreational or ecological purposes, are vital for individual well-being. This study investigates the relationship between access to green spaces and life satisfaction, hypothesizing that greater access to green spaces is associated with higher levels of life satisfaction. Initially the predictors were a satisfaction with life scale and a nature relatedness scale. Also, physical activity was included as a covariate; however, as we will see the analysis showed that access to green spaces was the primary significant predictor.
